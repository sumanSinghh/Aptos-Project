# GiftCard Smart Contract

## Vision

The **GiftCard** smart contract enables the creation and management of digital gift cards on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to issue gift cards with a specific balance and provides a mechanism for redeeming them. This contract aims to offer a secure and transparent way to handle digital gift cards, enhancing the convenience of token-based gifting.

## Features

- **Create Gift Card**:

  - Allows users to create a new gift card with a specified balance for a recipient.
  - The balance is initially set on the gift card and remains unredeemed until used.

- **Redeem Gift Card**:
  - Enables users to redeem the gift card balance by transferring the amount to the redeemer's account.
  - Ensures that each gift card can only be redeemed once.

## Future Scope

1. **Gift Card Expiry**:

   - Implement expiration dates for gift cards to enhance security and manageability.

2. **Partial Redemption**:

   - Support partial redemption of gift cards, allowing users to redeem a portion of the balance.

3. **Transferability**:

   - Enable the transfer of gift cards between users, adding flexibility in how gift cards can be used.

4. **Gift Card History**:
   - Add features to track and display the history of gift card transactions for better transparency.

The **GiftCard** contract aims to simplify the management of digital gift cards, providing a reliable and user-friendly solution for token-based gifting on the Aptos blockchain.
